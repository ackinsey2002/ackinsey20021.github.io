		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p id="text" class="special">Hello, my name is Ashley Kinsey. My hometown is Bamberg, SC which is approximately one hour from Columbia. I am currently a junior at UofSC and I am majoring in biology. I hope to become a speech pathologist after completing graduate school. </p>
		<p id="hide" class="hidden"> My hometown is really small and unheard of most of the time. I went to a small highschool where the graduating class was less than 80 students. Moving to a big college was a huge transition but a fun one at that. I have really enjoyed my time here at the university so far. In my free time, I love to read, watch movies, and hang out with friends. I find myself spending a lot of time at home with my family on the weekends enjoying time with them. I also enjoy spending time with my boyfriend. When I am not with them, I am most likely studying, as being a biology major requires a lot of hard work.  </p>

		<h3>My Future Career Plans</h3>
		<p id="text1" class="special1"> I am currently a junior and I am majoring in biological sciences. I recently decided to pursue a minor in education. Throughout my college career, I was extremely unsure with what I wanted to pursue a career in. I went back and forth between a job in the medical field, a biologist in a laboratory, and so much more. It was not until last year that I set my heart on a specific career. </p>
		<p id="hide1" class="hidden1">I recently shadowed a speech pathologist who works with children in an outpatient setting and knew immediately that I aspired to be one of the lucky people that obtained this career. During my time there, I observed that she mainly works with small children who have several different needs when it comes to learning. I viewed her working with kids that had autism, developmental delays, and other children with many different disabilities. Her office created a suitable and welcoming environment for inclusiveness among all children with special needs and/or children in general. Her attitude and knowledge towards helping kids who had a range of different learning styles or needs was extremely eye-opening and beneficial for me to see how to approach kids with special needs when it comes time to instruct them on specific curriculum. This experience helped me finally decide a career path while also guiding me in what minor to choose as well. </p>
